Chap03 - Working with Files:

simple_write.c - Using write.

simple_read.c  - Using read and write.

copy_system.c  - Uses low-level system calls to copy one file to
                 another.

copy_block.c   - Improved version of copy_system.c, which copies 
                 blocks of data between the files.

copy_stdio.c   - Uses library calls to further improve the speed
                 of the above programs, by buffering the file input 
                 and output.

printdir.c     - Print out the contents of your home directory 
                 (which you should write into the relevant parts of main).

printdir2.c    - Improved version of the above that takes the directory
                 as an argument.

mmap_eg.c      - Needs Linux 2.0. Maps a file into memory as an array and
                 then alters its contents.
